I trained a recurrent neural network on the Oxford English Dictionary. When you tweet a word (real or made up) @ the bot, you're seeding that generator. The invented words it tweets automatically every 90 minutes are created by smashing together random sequences of characters with a genetic algorithm until something that looks (sort of) like a real word comes out.
